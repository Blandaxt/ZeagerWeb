# Buildgame
My game after it is run to it's development build. 

## How to use

Download the app. Then run it on your device. It can only run on laptops and desktops for now with mac. 

## Controls

Use W (up), s (down), a (left), d (right) for character control. 

## Goal

The basis of this game is to collect items loke orbs and keys around the field. This is why it is labeled RPG (role playing game) where the user goes on an advandture towards new discoveries. 

## How it is made: 

1. This app is made using the unity engine. The script is made using the C# programming language. The type of game is a 2D | Top-Down (Slight Angle). The character art work is made using sprites which is a two-dimensional bitmap that can be used to create the illusion of movement. 

2. The environement is made using tile sheets. A tile is a small image, usually rectangular or isometric, that acts like a puzzle piece of art for building larger images. By grouping them together, i can create a map section of my game area. 

3. I used some free source tile sheets like trees, rocks, barrels and other items layed out in my game. 

## Time: 

If i had more time, i would add sound effects to my characters actions. I would also have added BGM (background music), and added some enemies that would impend the characters journey.
